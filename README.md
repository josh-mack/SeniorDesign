Project Goal

We are designing a robot that can map 3D environments using  a Microsoft Kinect sensor and an i-create for VR applications. The Kinect sensor is a RGB D camera capable of both standard video capture and various depths of objects within an image. While Microsoft has provided 3D imaging software called Kinect Fusion, it is mainly limited to static objects. We will be implementing Kintinuous, an open-source software capable of generating whole environments in 3D. This software extends Kinect Fusion's capability by stitching together the 3D captures as you move through a building with the Kinect. 
 
    We will have the Kinect attached to an i-create, which is a programmable robot by the company behind Roomba. The challenge will be programming the robot to traverse hallways and rooms, so that Kinect sensor can capture the environments correctly. Our plan is to implement Wall-E, a previous project that used ultrasonic sound so the i-robot can traverse hallways, but also extending its functionality so we can move about a room which contains more obstacles.
 
    Lastly we will use an Oculus Rift to view and move through these 3D environments .
